├── api/                # API documentation
└── user/               # User guides
```

### **✅ SECURITY & SECRETS**
```bash

├── old-contracts/      # Previous contract versions
└── experiments/        # Experimental code
```

---

## 🔒 **Security Enhancements**

### **✅ Enhanced .gitignore**
- **🔐 Wallet Files**: Never commit private keys or seed phrases
- **🔑 Environment Files**: All `.env` files gitignored except examples
- **📄 Deployment Logs**: Contract addresses kept private
- **🗂️ Sensitive Configs**: All production configs secured

### **✅ Privacy Measures**
- **🕵️ Stealth Deployment**: Ready for private testnet deployment
- **📝 No Source Verification**: Contracts deploy without readable code
- **🔒 Private Configuration**: Sensitive data properly isolated
- **🚫 Public Exposure**: Zero public visibility during testing

---

## 🚀 **Ready for Stealth Testnet Deployment**

### **✅ Deployment Script Ready**
```bash
./deployment/testnet/deploy-stealth.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Deploys WITHOUT source verification (maximum privacy)
- ✅ Validates wallet balance before deployment
- ✅ Provides clear privacy status confirmation
- ✅ Saves contract addresses securely
- ✅ Guides you through next steps

### **✅ Configuration Template**
```bash
deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env.example
```

**Copy to create your private config:**
```bash
cp deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env.example deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env
# Then edit with your private key
```

---

## 📋 **What Was Cleaned Up**

### **🗑️ Removed (Legacy/Unused)**
- ❌ Old emission systems
- ❌ Legacy NAV testing
- ❌ Deprecated transparency components
- ❌ Unused vault implementations
- ❌ Legacy cron configurations
- ❌ Temporary files and logs
- ❌ Scattered documentation

### **📁 Archived (For Reference)**
- 📦 Previous contract versions
- 📦 Old documentation
- 📦 Experimental components
- 📦 Legacy systems
- 📦 Historical files

### **🔄 Reorganized (Better Structure)**
- ✅ Smart contracts in dedicated folder
- ✅ Documentation properly organized
- ✅ Python components structured
- ✅ Security files isolated
- ✅ Deployment scripts environment-specific

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps - Ready for Action**

### **🕵️ Immediate: Stealth Testnet Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Configure your private key
cp deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env.example deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env
nano deployment/testnet/config/stealth.env

# 2. Fund your testnet wallet (get BTC from faucet)
# Address: 0xEb762Ce2c1268362feDFAEFDe5eE32Cc5351FA29

# 3. Deploy stealthily
./deployment/testnet/deploy-stealth.sh

# 4. Test privately with your deployed contracts
cd neurons
python test_real_contracts.py
```
