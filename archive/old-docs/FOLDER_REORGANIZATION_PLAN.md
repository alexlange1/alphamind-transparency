# 🗂️ AlphaMind Folder Reorganization Plan

## 📋 **Current Issues Identified**

### **🚨 Problems with Current Structure:**
```bash
❌ Too many files in root directory (40+ files)
❌ Documentation scattered everywhere
❌ Legacy/unused components still present
❌ No clear separation between production and development
❌ Sensitive information not properly isolated
❌ Inconsistent naming conventions
❌ Mixed old/new system files
```

### **🎯 Goals for Reorganization:**
```bash
✅ Clean, professional structure
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Security-first organization
✅ Easy navigation for developers
✅ Production-ready layout
✅ Stealth deployment preparation
```

- Environment-specific configurations
- Deployment logs and addresses
- Temporary files and caches
- Local testing artifacts
```

### **🕵️ Stealth-Ready Structure**

deployment/testnet/
├── deploy-stealth.sh          # Stealth deployment script
├── config/
│   ├── stealth.env            # Stealth configuration
│   └── privacy.json           # Privacy settings
└── scripts/
    ├── deploy-no-verify.sh    # Deploy without verification
    └── monitor-private.sh     # Private monitoring
```

## 📊 **Before vs After Comparison**

### **🚨 BEFORE (Current Issues)**
```bash
Root files: 40+ files scattered everywhere
Documentation: 15+ files in root, hard to find
Security: Wallet files mixed with code
Legacy: Old systems cluttering workspace
Navigation: Confusing, hard to find anything
Deployment: Scripts scattered across folders
```

### **✅ AFTER (Clean & Professional)**
```bash
Root files: 6 essential files only
Documentation: Organized in docs/ with clear structure
Security: All sensitive data in secure/ folder
Legacy: Archived in archive/ folder
Navigation: Clear, logical folder structure
Deployment: Environment-specific organization
```
